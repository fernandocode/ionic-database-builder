# Contributing

Have you found a bug, or want to develop a new feature?

1. [Look for Pull Requests](https://github.com/fernandocode/database-builder/pulls) if something is not already implemented;
2. [Check if there is no Issue related to this](https://github.com/fernandocode/database-builder/issues)? (If there is not one, so that the use case can be checked);
3. Make the necessary changes, add tests to what has been implemented, run the tests and submit a Pull Request with the changes (Comment what was done, and relate the Issue). As soon as possible it will be verified, and if approved it will be available in the next release of the library.
